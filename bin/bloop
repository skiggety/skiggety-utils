# These 'bloop' scripts mostly just makes a fun shape roll by on your screen, not too fast.  It's mostly just
# silliness, but it's actually useful to have a couple of filler scripts when you're popping up a bunch of terminals
# using cron on a mac like I do.  Sometimes it catches a couple of keystrokes if it pops up when I'm typing and they can
# unfortunately become part of the command, so a cron line like:
#
#     50 9 * * * osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "bloo;review-firstlife-status;oop;exit"'
#
# ...can be a little less likely to get tripped up than without 'bloo' and 'oop'.  And also you can make your computer
# go 'bloop' whenever you want now, which I think is a thing computers are supposed to do ;-)

# I don't need these, but just to say, this script is part of firstlife:
# . $SKIGGETY_UTILS_DIR/lib/skiggety-utils.bash || exit 1
# . $SKIGGETY_UTILS_DIR/lib/firstlife.bash || exit_with_error 'could not use common firstlife code'

bloo;oop

# This script is a very fancy version of running "vim `which NAME`".  You can edit a number of
# scripts whether they exist in the path, at the path given, or need to be created new (in which
# case it starts from a template).

# TODO^3: accept a "-a" option, and use "which -a" in that case.  This would be useful for "vimwhich
# -a dashboard", since you would usually have a custom "dashboard" script in $your_project/PWD_BIN/

# TODO^2: consider making this into a generic "editwhich" program, that supports other editors

# NOTE: where do you want new scripts to be created, and what template file would you like to start with? Set the values of these variables in your ~/.bashrc file:
# TODO: debug DEFAULT_SCRIPT_LOCATION, I think it's not working
DEFAULT_SCRIPT_LOCATION=${DEFAULT_SCRIPT_LOCATION:-"$SKIGGETY_UTILS_DIR/bin"}
# TODO: DEFAULT_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE=${DEFAULT_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE:-"$SKIGGETY_UTILS_DIR/lib/templates/blank.rb"}

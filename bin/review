# This program displays output of other programs and refreshes.

# For example, lets say you want to grep your text files for trailing spaces,
# you could do so with the command 'grep -RI " $" .', but it might be nice to
# keep running that command and updating a terminal with fresh output while you
# eliminate the trailing spaces in another terminal. In that case, prepend
# "review" to the command to get 'review grep -RI " $" .'. The grep will run
# repeatedly you stop it, waiting a few seconds in between each run (this time
# will adjust automatically.

# This program displays output of a given command and refreshes periodically.  By default, the delay is dynamic so you
# don't use up too many resources when nothing is changing but it is responsive when the output is changing.

# For example, lets say you want to grep your text files for trailing spaces, you could do so with the command 'grep -RI
# " $" .', but it might be nice to keep running that command and updating a terminal with fresh output while you
# eliminate the trailing spaces in another terminal. In that case, prepend "review" to the command to get 'review grep
# -RI " $" .'. The grep will run repeatedly until you stop it, waiting a few seconds in between each run (this time will
# adjust automatically.

# TODO: would it be smart to have a cron job that runs 'pkill review' every day at ~7pm on my work laptop? Or should I
# instead strive to make the default behavior of this, and review-dev, so reasonable that it's not required? Also, can I
# make this exit gracefully when pkill runs (possibly with -HUP)?

# TODO: we might need a control key to wake it up and make it refresh immediately (accept a control character or signal
# to refresh now), but we might not need it now that we're 'listening' to the file system

# TODO: accept a flag to stop running if the wait gets longer than some specified amount
# TODO: accept log file that logs output, changes, feequencies/counts, etc.
# TODO: ensure we never mess with the colors, test with "review git diff"

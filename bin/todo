  # TODO: re-implement without it being such a hack. Probably use Python (see old program "status"):

  # TODO TODO: highlight TODO's

  # TODO TODO TODO: 	alternate syntax idea: start all todo's as to-not-do's, add exclamation points to vote, add dollar signs to vote that they could make you money, automate a background process to clean it up into a vote tally format, ( e.g. TODO!!! becomes TODO^3, TODO^3! becomes TODO^4, maybe have a vim macro to quickly upvote things, then the todo program [hashtag #TODO_PROGRAM to discuss the program itself] should sort stuff based on that (but maybe also be aware of indentation
  # TODO TODO TODO TODO: when called from a terminal, this program should interactively check with the user if they want to do replacements like "TODO TODO"-->"TODO^2" before displaying sorted output
    # TODO TODO: there should also be a "force" mode with a "-f/--force" flag that can do the replacements without asking
  # TODO: todo should accept a path ( to a file or directory) to use in place of "." for grep. This way you could run "todo bin/todo" and see the TODO's in this file cleanly without the ingorable lines.
  # TODO: non-interactive [read-only] mode should be the default when this is called from a script (output is not a tty)
  # TODO: avoid scanning large non-text files:
  # TODO: perhaps todo could do the same thing with an alternate word. For example, you could pass in "-w TECHDEBT" if you had things like TECHDEBT^3 in your code
  # TODO: add a command line option to specify a minimum number of votes, so if you pass "--minimum-votes 3", "TODO TODO TODO" or TODO^3 will show up, but not "TODO TODO"
# TODO: consider spinning this project off, with a not-so-clever name like "tood" or something

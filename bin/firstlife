# TODO^88: ======== First real demo with Darren using firstlife himself ================
# TODO^85: ======== Another real demo with Darren using firstlife himself with some decent code readability ============
# TODO^31: track stats of all kinds
# TODO^43: and firstlife needs a way to keep you on pace, too
# TODO: if a second firstlife pops up, maybe it should take over and the old one gracefully exits?

# EASY TODO^83: prompt user to back up ~/firstlife ( $FIRSTLIFE_DIR ) as part of setup/maintenance

# EASY TODO^86: help user start firstlife (including morning routine) with cron like I did, automate ensuring a line in local crontab, and use 'crontab-verbose'?
# - TODO^23 (IN_PROGRESS, NOW): it should set the terminal title

# EASY TODO^86: move elsewhere:
function update_todo_graph {
    # TODO^88: (IN_PROGRESS, EASY) make sure TODO graph exists in an environment variable so you don't commit it:
    # - TODO^89 (IN_PROGRESS, EASY): if there's no environment variable, suggest the user start a new one and save the link in their bashrc, where the template should be ready.

}

# TODO: exit_if_another_terminal_took_over
# - TODO: ultimately, combine for exit_if_another_terminal_or_day_took_over_with_accumulated_errors

# EASY TODO^86: use 'firstlife-delegate --with-reward' pretty much universally, instead of calling shellask directly

# TODO^60: make this program aware of your productivity points, as in, keep going until you have enough:
firstlife-work # TODO^2?: || exit_with_error "firstlife-work FAILED"

# EASY TODO^43: (TEST) help with evening routine (maybe only use exit_if_day_is_over in child scripts, or call this from inside # exit_if_day_is_over)
firstlife-evening || accumulate_error "need to wrap up habits in the evening"

# EASY TODO^3: every time I do this graph update should be in a routine like morning or evening so it can get skipped:
update_todo_graph # TODO: only if using today_todo

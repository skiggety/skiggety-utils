f_offset=2 # 9 makes C red, which feels right....it will be red in the background with a b_offset of zero...but maybe manipulating it for a red background would be good?. FWIW, 4 makes a red F, and 2 makes a red G

b_offset="7" # 5 and 7 are pretty and subtle, and makes sure each note name is a slightly different hue than the background, so each one occupied wider 'hue space" and they are more distinct from eachother. 10 and 2 are pretty close to the same effect

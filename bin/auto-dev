# This script continuously displays and refreshes the dashboard

#   TODO TODO: consider 'review-dev' as a name. It makes obvious sense, and shell tab completion would let you know that it
#   exists if you were about to run 'review dev', which would help you get any custom parameters. Only thing is, if I
#   have a default version at $SKIGGETY_UTILS_DIR , then tab completion will steer you towards it when you don't have
#   custom parameters, so If I do that, I might want to get rid of this copy and just leave it to users to make
#   PWD_BIN/review-dev when it makes sense, maybe even provide a template version by renaming this version to
#   bin/default_review-dev or the like.
#   TODO: like it says above, consider renaming this to default something

review dev

# A script with this name in a PWD_BIN directory should do a complete continuous integration cycle, whatever that entails, printing concise useful output, and exit on 0 only on success. This script does that for skiggety-utils. Use "review ci" or "auto-ci" to make it run continuously.
# TODO TODO: possible script renaming--ci means continuos. This is just the integration part. "auto-ci" could become "ci" and this would become what? "i"? Or maybe every scrtipt that does one cycle and is meant to be changed and used with review has a name that ends in "-cycle"? I dunno. Something to think about.

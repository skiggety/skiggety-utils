# A script with this name in a PWD_BIN directory should do a complete continuous integration cycle, whatever that
# entails, printing concise useful output, and exit on 0 only on success.  This script does that for skiggety-utils.
# Use "review ci" or "review-ci" to make it run continuously.

# TODO^4: possible script renaming--ci means continuous.  This is just the integration part. "review-ci" could become
# "ci" and this would become what? "i"? Or maybe every scrtipt that does one cycle and is meant to be changed and used
# with review has a name that ends in "-cycle"? I dunno.  Something to think about.
#  # TODO: one idea is that 'ci' is something very high level that uses review heavily but probably uses it once to wait
#  for a commit, and overall is responsible for doing a git pull and calling something like 'integrate' (like what this
#  script is now) that mostly manages the running of 'dev', maybe specifying read-only mode or whatever.  'ci' should
#  also keep a prominent display of the latest commit or two with timestamps.
#    TODO^4: ...so rename this script 'integrate' to get the ball rolling?

# TODO: I think this script should save the output of dev and simply cat it if there is no update from git

# TODO^2: what if there are updates to the top-level ci script? should it re-exec itself?

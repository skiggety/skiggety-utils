./bin/today_todo:137:    todo_output="$(vital-todo --color always $EXCLUDE_DIR_ARGS | cat -n )" # TODO: (DEBUG [01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) which todo are you calling
./bin/today_todo:9:# TODO^22: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) gotta DELETE this script eventually, after moving all functionality to vital
./installers/skiggety.bash:10:# TODO^41: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) use completion markers like the basic installer so I can stop re-running this
./bin/today_todo:193:    # TODO^51: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) function extract to do with other keywords
./bin/vital-todo:9:# TODO^51: TESTING [01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K exclude that .tmp driveupload thingy:
./bin/vimwhich:25:        # TODO^54: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) this should share code with newbin, or call newbin in a mode where it doesn't open the editor, it just dumped a new script in $HOME/ instead of a bin dir, which wasn't too good.
./installers/skiggety.bash:66:        # TODO^69: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) also make sure Zerothlife takes care of it itself, asking the user to put it in their bashrc
./bin/newbin:31:    # TODO^131: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) I think this script, newbin, should move scripts to zerothlife when appropriate, not some dashboard running async, this chmod is not the only thing that has gotten screwed up:
./installers/zerothlife:7:# - TODO^140: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) make this, and maybe all installers, optional.  We could use marker files to keep track
./installers/signal:37:  # TODO^150: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) IMPLEMENT: ...
./lib/skiggety-utils.bash:135:    # TODO^181: TESTING [01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K NOW:

./bin/today_todo:86:    # TODO^195: ([01;31m[KIN_PROGRESS[m[K) also most of these paragraphs could be function extracted...:

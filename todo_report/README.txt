./bin/templates/firstlife-morning.routine.TEMPLATE:41:# TODO^122: We need a way to only do a section of code once per day, kind of like using 'firstlife-delegate --limit-n-times-per-x 1 day', but something we can put around 'firstlife-break'
./bin/templates/firstlife-morning.routine.TEMPLATE:77:# TODO^122: We need a way to only do a section of code once per day, kind of like using 'firstlife-delegate --limit-n-times-per-x 1 day', but something we can put around paragraphs like this one:
./bin/templates/firstlife-evening.routine.TEMPLATE:17:    # TODO^123: (IN_PROGRESS) once we are using zerothlife.bash:
./README.md:126:  - TODO^125: move 'vital' data (to do list) to private repo (skiggety utils should help set up)
./bin/firstlife-battery-status:5:# TODO^126?: consider whether this should be integrated into firstlife-status or kept separate, or if there should be a way to do both (right now I'm leaning towards the first option, integrate)
./bin/firstlife-setup:11:# TODO^135: generate example crontab file, (it can start as an empty stub) including:
./bin/firstlife-status:83:# TODO^152: similarly, show current alarms, especially if muted!!
./bin/firstlife:5:# TODO^197: can I alias 'y' and 'n'?

./README.md:130:  - TODO^109: (IN_PROGRESS) move 'vital' data (to do list) to private repo (skiggety utils should help set up)

./bin/templates/firstlife-morning.routine.TEMPLATE:15:# - EASY TODO^110: (IN_PROGRESS) (manually) cron more stuff instead of chaining everything off the morning
./bin/crontab-verbose:20:    # TODO^111: (IN_PROGRESS, NOW) also open example files, if available (so 'firstlife' can suggest an example crontab file)

./bin/firstlife-morning:7:# - TODO^111: if a second firstlife pops up, maybe it should take over and the old one gracefully exits? (PPID in a marker file?)
./README.md:128:      - TODO^112: (IN_PROGRESS) at least check out the repo, maybe with a skiggety-utils installer
./bin/firstlife-morning:6:# TODO^113: (IN_PROGRESS) have a way for a new instance and a running instance to avoid interfering. The new one could take over and the old one could exit gracefully.
./bin/templates/firstlife-morning.routine.TEMPLATE:28:firstlife_exit_if_needed # TODO^114: (IN_PROGRESS) # use this and firstlife-preempt-same-script wiiidely, especially routines that might get scheduled multiple times:
./bin/templates/firstlife-work.routine.TEMPLATE:21:firstlife-reward "looked at URGENT stuff" # TODO^114: (IN_PROGRESS, NOW) this is important, TEST against getting to this point (URGENT stuff done) as a benchmark
./lib/firstlife.bash:40:# TODO^114: use firstlife_exit_if_needed liberally instead of exit_if_day_is_over (all over the codebase)
./README.md:130:  - TODO^116: move 'vital' data (to do list) to private repo (skiggety utils should help set up)
./bin/firstlife-pomodoro:70:# EASY TODO^120: also MUTE for $SLEEP_FOR seconds

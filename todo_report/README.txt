./bin/firstlife-battery-status:6:# - TODO^120: which means I should move this over and take it out of crontab soon, so it stops popping up so much
./bin/crontab-verbose:20:    # TODO^121: also open example files, if available (so 'firstlife' can suggest an example crontab file)
./bin/firstlife-gamify-pomodoro:8:    exit_with_error "TODO^122: IMPLEMENT for real" # Call firstlife-gamify with a new argument to limit the total time, so you can do a pomodoros worth of work a few minutes at a time to make it easier to get started.
./README.md:126:  - TODO^125: move 'vital' data (to do list) to private repo (skiggety utils should help set up)
./bin/firstlife-battery-status:5:# TODO^125?: consider whether this should be integrated into firstlife-status or kept separate, or if there should be a way to do both (right now I'm leaning towards the first option, integrate)
./bin/firstlife-setup:11:# TODO^133: generate example crontab file, (it can start as an empty stub) including:
./bin/firstlife-status:83:# TODO^152: similarly, show current alarms, especially if muted!!
./bin/firstlife:5:# TODO^197: can I alias 'y' and 'n'?

./bin/templates/firstlife-multitask.routine.TEMPLATE:16:# EASY TODO^89: inside this script and elsewhere, use 'firstlife-delegate --with-reward' instead of calling 'shellask' directly:
./demo_in_docker:12:# TODO^93: help the user with mapping the disk through, so he can edit files with any editor, for firstlife's sake
./demo_in_docker:13:# TODO^93: make sure (for firstlife demo'ing) that we can get through enough of the demo_in_docker script with an alternate $EDITOR
